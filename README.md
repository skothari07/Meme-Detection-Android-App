# Meme-Detection-Android-App using Tensorflow Lite
An Android app that takes input as image via photo picker and classifies if that image is Meme or not. On-Device ML (.tflite) </br>
To know more about underlying model, checkout [Meme Detection using Deep Learning](https://github.com/skothari07/Meme-Detection-using-Deep-Learning.git).

### About On-Device ML
* TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools to help developers run TensorFlow models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices. 
* This is an prototype for integrating [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/) into Android application.
### Advantages:
* User data privacy preserved
* Low Latency
* No network/internet needed. Users can use the app even when they don’t have internet access.
* If inference happens on the device, then we don’t need to run servers. When the app becomes more popular and gets more users then there is no need to scale up anything, since there is no centralized bottleneck.
